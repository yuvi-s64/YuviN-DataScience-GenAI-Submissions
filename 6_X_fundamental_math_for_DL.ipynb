        "The chain rule gets us a big chunk of the way towards what we need in terms of using derivatives to understand parameter optimisation in deep learning (which will be explained in the module don't worry), except for one thing. Everything we've looked at so far has looked at changes in $y$ with respect to a single $x$. We theoretically could have just one feature, but in ML/AI practice that is extremely unlikely. If we have multiple features ($x$'s), which we will, we need _partial derivatives_.\n",

In our earlier discussion we were finding the ration between $\\Delta y$ and $\\Delta x$. Given this is a subset of the overall problem we use the lower case version of delta to show the partial ... so the notation would be $\\delta_{x_{1}}$ (double subscripts is a bit yucky in LaTex ... sorry). Let's look at the partial derivative of $X_{3}$:\n",
